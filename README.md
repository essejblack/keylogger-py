# Keylogger

A simple keylogger built using Python and the **keyboard** library. This script logs all key presses and saves them to a file.

## Features

- Logs every key press in real-time
- Saves the pressed keys in a log file
- Easy to use and run

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Keyboard (for detecting key presses)

## Setup and Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required library:

```bash
pip install keyboard
```
3. Run the script:
```
python keylogger.py
```
The keylogger will start recording key presses and save them to a file.

Note: Make sure to run the script with the necessary permissions, as it listens to keyboard events.
